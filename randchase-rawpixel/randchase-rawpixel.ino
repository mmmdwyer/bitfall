 This raw-neopixel library allows me to save enough memory on an ATTINY85
 to handle more than 83 pixels.  It can even handle the 144 super-dense
 strips!

// These values depend on which pin your string is connected to and what board you are using

// These values are for the pin that connects to the Data Input pin on the LED strip. They correspond to...

// Arduino Yun:     Digital Pin 8
// DueMilinove/UNO: Digital Pin 12
// Arduino MeagL    PWM Pin 4
// Digispark:       Pin 0

// Note that you could also include the DigitalWriteFast header file to not need to to this lookup.

// These are the timing constraints taken mostly from the WS2812 datasheets 
// These are chosen to be conservative and avoid problems rather than for maximum throughput

// need 250us. This is set to the longer delay here to make sure things work, but if
// you want to get maximum refresh speed, you can try decreasing this until your pixels
// start to flicker.
